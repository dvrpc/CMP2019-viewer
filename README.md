# CMP 2019
A CMP is a systematic process for managing congestion that provides information on transportation system performance. It recommends a range of strategies to minimize congestion and enhance the mobility of people and goods. These multimodal strategies include, but are not limited to, operational improvements, travel demand management, policy approaches, and additions to capacity. The CMP advances the goals of the DVRPC Long-Range Plan and strengthens the connection between the Plan and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
